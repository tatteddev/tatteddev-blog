Welcome to my little corner of the internet. You can call me Tatted Dev. This blog is where I'll share what I'm building, what I'm learning, and how I'm growing—not just as a developer, but as a creator, problem-solver, and someone obsessed with making cool things.

I'm not here to pretend I've got everything figured out. I'm here to document the journey. The wins, the mistakes, the experiments, the things I wish someone had told me earlier—all of it.

## What I'm About

I live at the intersection of code, creativity, and curiosity. I'm the kind of person who will write a backend service one day, model a 3D world in Blender the next, and then dive into game design or AI tools just because it feels like unexplored territory.

If it's about building, experimenting, or pushing boundaries—I'm probably interested.

Some of the things you'll see here:

- **Breaking down what it's like to create apps, games, and platforms from scratch.**
- **Thoughts on tools, tech stacks, and workflows** (spoiler: I lean heavy into .NET, React, and modern cloud setups).
- **Experiments in game dev, AI, 3D modeling, and whatever else pulls me down the rabbit hole.**
- **The behind-the-scenes reality of trying to do this as an indie dev/studio.**

## Why "Tatted Dev"?

The name's a reflection of me—it's personal, it's visible, it sticks. Just like tattoos, the projects and ideas I work on leave a mark. They're permanent reminders of where I've been and where I'm heading.

This blog is my digital ink.

## What's Next

This is just the starting point. Expect posts that are raw, honest, and hopefully useful. I'm writing for people like me—builders who want to learn, tinker, and maybe feel a little less alone in the chaos of making things.

So stick around. Let's build something great together.
